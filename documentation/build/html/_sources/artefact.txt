After you have tested both the Users and Media, you will be prompt to provide your contact details. This process you create you an account on our developer portal and you'll be sent an Email with a link to log into this portal.

The last part of this process is generating the T-SQL that is required during the deployment of the Coach product.  The T-SQL this will be generated will describe to Coach everything that you have entered during this process.  You will have been sent an Email through out this process containing a link that you can use to modify your recorder configuration.

You will see a ``Generate Sql`` button at the bottom of the progress bar, situated on the left side of the page.  Please press this.
