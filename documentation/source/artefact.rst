After you have tested both the Users and Media, you will be prompted to provide your contact details.

An account will be created in our developer portal for you. You will receive an Email with details on how to log in.

The last part of this process is generating the T-SQL that is required during the deployment of the **Coach** product.  The T-SQL will be generated and will describe to **Coach** everything that you have entered during this process.  You will have been sent an Email through out this process containing a link that you can use to modify your recorder configuration.

You will see a ``Generate Sql`` button at the bottom of the progress bar, situated on the left side of the page.  Please press this.
