The :ref:`gettingstarted-label` section   is the best place to start if you are a developer tasked with the job of integrating your recorder with **Coach**.

In this :ref:`gettingstarted-label` section you will be guided through how to:

* obtain the RESTful api middleware
* confirm that the middleware deployment is correct
* build search criteria with our `Integration Tool <http://dev.qualtrak.com/Cit>`_
* create your connector
* test your search criteria with your new middleware
* generate an artefact required during the installation of **Coach**
