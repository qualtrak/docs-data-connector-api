The Getting started section :doc:`/gettingstarted`  is the best place to start if you are a developer tasked with the job of integrating your recorder with Coach.

In this ``Getting Started`` section you will be guided through how to:

* get the RESTFul api middleware
* how to confirm middleware deployment is correct
* how to build search criteria via our Test Suite
* how to create your connector
* how to test your search criteria against your middleware
* how to generate an artefact required during the installation of Coach
